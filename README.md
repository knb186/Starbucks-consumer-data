In this project, I analyzed the consumer behavior data from Starbucks. I used the pandas, numpy, math, json, matplotlib, and sklearn libraries.

In this repository, the starbucks_capstone.ipynb file includes my work. The profile.json, portfolio.json and transcript.json files
are the data I worked on
